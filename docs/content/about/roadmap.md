# Roadmap

The following are things we're thinking about, and may be added as-needed.

- Add support for:
    - Stored procedures
    - Triggers
    - Users
    - Roles
    - Databases and Tablespaces
- Add per-method provider `Option` parameters for greater coverage of provider-specific capabilities and nuances.
- Improve on some of the convention-based design decisions, and support a fluent configuration syntax for handling types and data type mappings.
- Add database CRUD methods
- Add account management CRUD methods (for users and roles)

# Welcome

The `MJCZone.DapperMatic` library adds a number of extension methods to an `IDbConnection` instance.

Currently the methods revolve around DDL operations, such as creating, updating, selecting and dropping schemas, tables, columns, constraints, indexes, and views.

The intention of this library is to make these operations easy to use for a variety of purposes, while leveling the field between database providers. The methods provide a consistent way of managing DDL objects in a database, hopefully addressing the top 80% of use-cases typical applications need.

This is VERY Early in the release cycle for this project, use the APIs at your own risk.

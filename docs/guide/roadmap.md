# Roadmap

## Community-Driven Development

We believe the best features come from real user needs. **Have an idea for DapperMatic?** We'd love to hear from you!

🔗 **[Share your ideas on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mjczone/MJCZone.DapperMatic/discussions/categories/ideas)**

Your feedback and feature requests directly influence our development priorities. Whether it's a new database provider, enhanced DDL capabilities, or developer tooling improvements - we want to know what would make DapperMatic more valuable for your projects.

## Current Focus Areas

While we prioritize community feedback, here are the high-level areas we're actively considering:

### 🗄️ Database Provider Support

- **Oracle Database** - Enterprise database support
- **IBM DB2** - Mainframe and enterprise system integration
- **Azure SQL Database** - Cloud-specific optimizations and features

### 🔧 Enhanced DDL Capabilities  

- **Stored Procedures & Functions** - Creation, modification, and management
- **Triggers** - Database trigger lifecycle management
- **User-Defined Types** - Custom type creation and management
- **Advanced Partitioning** - Table partitioning across providers

### 🛠️ CLI Tooling

A comprehensive command-line tool for:
- **Schema Extraction** - Export existing database schemas
- **Schema Comparison** - Compare schemas across environments
- **Automatic Updates** - Apply schema changes with confidence
- **Schema Versioning** - Track and manage schema evolution
- **Documentation Generation** - Automated schema diagrams and docs

### 🌐 ASP.NET Core Integration

We're exploring a companion **ASP.NET Core Web API** package that would provide:
- **Permission-Based Security** - Role-based access to DDL operations
- **RESTful DDL APIs** - HTTP endpoints for all DapperMatic operations
- **Audit Logging** - Track all schema changes with full context
- **Web Dashboard** - Browser-based schema management interface

This would enable secure, controlled database schema management through web APIs with proper authentication and authorization.

## How We Prioritize

Development priorities are determined by:

1. **Community requests** - Features with the most interest get attention first
2. **Real-world usage** - Issues and needs from production environments
3. **Cross-provider consistency** - Features that work across all supported databases
4. **Maintainability** - Sustainable additions that don't compromise code quality
